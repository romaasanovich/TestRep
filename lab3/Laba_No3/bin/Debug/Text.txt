"It was a record year for the richest people on earth, as the number of billionaires jumped 13% to 2,043 
from 1,810 last year, the first time ever that Forbes has pinned down more than 2,000 ten-figure-fortunes. 
Their total net worth rose by 18% to $7.67 trillion, also a record. The change in the number of billionaires
-- up 233 since the 2016 list -- was the biggest in the 31 years that Forbes has been tracking billionaires
globally. Gainers since last year’s list outnumbered losers by more than three to one."
